# Artificial Intelligence Exam Task

## Objective
The objective of this task is to enable you to demonstrate the knowledge of artificial intelligence and machine learning acquired during the elective AI course.

## Task
The task is to create a machine learning based solution to a real life problem.  
To fulfill the task, you need to follow and describe the procedure below:<br>

1. Research and select an application area and a real life problem, related to human practice of using data. It can be any brand of business or social activity, self-service or entertainment.
<br>

2. Collect and prepare appropriate data for developing a solution The preparation includes operations ensuring that the data is
<br>
    * meaningful – describes relevant and correctly measured features and observations
    * sufficient – describes various cases and feature occurrences, decided by testing
    * shaped – presented in a structure, appropriate for processing by machine learning algorithms
    * cleaned – repaired from missing values and outliers
    * scaled – transform data distributions in comparable scales, when necessary
    * engineered – features analyzed and the most informative selected for further processing
<br>

3. Train appropriate models that can solve the problem
Select at least two or more machine learning algorithms to train a model based on a training data set. Choose between supervised and unsupervised methods, or implement neural networks and deep learning.
<br>


4. Test the models created by the learners
Implement the models on the test data sets to predict the output.
<br>

5. Validate the models
Calculate appropriate parameters validating the accuracy of prediction.
Iterate the operations listed above at least twice, trying to improve the quality of the models, as much as possible.
<br>

6. Compare the results of validation and select the best performing model.
<br>

7. Store the trained model for further implementation.
<br>

8. Create a simple web application to interact with the model
<br>

9. Demonstrate the operability of the final product, testing it with new and unknown data.

## Delivery
You are expected to upload your solution to Wiseflow in a zip archive file within the specified time. There is no requirement for traditional report. The delivery consists of

* Jupyter notebook
* application code or a link to the external repository, where it resides
* data source or a link to the external repository, where it can be found 

The Jupyter notebook is provided in two formats: ipynb and pdf, and contains the
* machine learning code
* explanation of the solution development process

Consider taking use of visual illustrations and diagramming in the text. Consider including conclusion and reflection on it.

## Exam
The exam is individual and oral, censored and graded. It takes up to 30 minutes per student, including the grading.

During the exam you are expected to make a short presentation and a demonstration of your product, and then answer questions of the examiners. The questions refer to the project, but are not limited to it, and may relate to other topics from subject curriculum.
